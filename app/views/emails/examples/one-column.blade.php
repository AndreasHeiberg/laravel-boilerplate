		The world scouts at us whale hunters
	</h1>

	At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart;
	he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the
	blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every
	ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
	<br><br>

	So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not
	notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings
	should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.
